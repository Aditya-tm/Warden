### Defender
- A wide range of modules, automatic and manual, designed to counter many common patterns of bad actors and thwart large scale attacks
- A very customizable experience: every single module can be fine tuned to better fit your community
- A smart way to subdivide your userbase in ranks, so that your regulars will never be caught in the crossfire
- An extremely versatile module, [Warden](https://github.com/AdityaXJha/Warden/wiki), that allows you to define complex custom rules to better moderate, monitor and manage your community
- A unique (and optional) way to let your community help *you* when you can't
- The peace of mind that only a smart automod can bring :-)
